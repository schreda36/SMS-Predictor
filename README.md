# SMS/Text Predictor Project

This project aims to predict the most probable next word, much like most smartphone SMS applications will do. It uses a corpus from multiple sources, including Twitter, blogs and news sources. Given the previous words typed in by the user the application will present the user with the three most likely words to be used. If a new sentence is started, common prepositions are presented.
